# TODOs

### Transfer learning

* Use different base models in TRA

### Data augmentation

* https://github.com/pyyush/SpecAugment/blob/master/augment.py
* https://www.kaggle.com/CVxTz/audio-data-augmentation/notebook#Data-augmentation-definition-:

### Learning rate schedule

Function callback:

* https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler
* The func might take more inputs, use partial to do hypa tune on it

Cyclic learning rate:

* https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR/blob/master/clr_callback.py
