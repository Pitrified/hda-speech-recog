% MFCC + HMM
The first classification models used Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients to
compactly extract features from the audio signal and a Hidden Markov model to
compute the prediction, leveraging the HMM ability of modelling sequences
\cite{mfcchmm103088}.
% ConvNets
Deep Neural Networks, in more recent years, provided efficient solutions
\cite{chensmallDNN} and Convolutional Neural Networks have been successfully
applied to exploit the spatial correlations in the spectrograms while keeping a
small memory footprint for the model \cite{sainathconvolutional}.
