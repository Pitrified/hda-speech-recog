\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusions}

A gripping conclusion

\MR{\textbf{What I would like to see here is:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a very short summary of what done, 
\item some (possibly) intelligent observations on the relevance and {\it applicability} of your algorithms / findings, 
\item what is still missing, and can be added in the future to extend your work.\\
\end{enumerate}
The idea is that this section should be {\it useful} and not just a repetition of the abstract (just \mbox{re-phrased} and written using a different tense...).}\\

\red{\textbf{Moreover:} being a project report, I would also like to see a specific paragraph stating 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[4)] what you have learned, and 
\item[5)] any difficulties you may have encountered.
\end{enumerate}}
