% A gripping conclusion

The task of identifing a command in a single audio sample has been successfully
solved, with varying degree of accuracy, by every architecture tested.

Further works might focus on different types of attention, and the performance
of SimpleNet and AreaNet should be evaluated on standard image
classification datasets, such as ImageNet.

Regarding the methodology used, a definite improvement would be using existing
frameworks for hyper-parameter tuning, such as Hypertune, readily available
with Keras Tuner library. A very interesting approach is Hyperband, that trains
every model built from the hyper-parameter grid for a few epochs, then prunes
the set of models, only keeping the best performing ones.

The methodical hyper-parameter analysis done while writing the report was very
informative, and while the plots confirmed what I believed to be the best
combinations, they gave me a couple of ideas regarding some explorations that I
had missed.
