\section{Processing Pipeline}
\label{sec:processing_architecture}

High level description of the approach: which processing blocks you used, what they do (in words) and how these were combined

High-level description of the involved processing blocks, i.e., you describe the {\it processing flow} and the rationale behind it

Nice diagram

\section{Signals and Features}
\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Google Dataset}

Measurement setup, data preprocess (describe the google dataset)

Train/validation/test

\subsection{Spectrograms}

Feature vectors: mel/mfcc

\section{Learning Framework}
\label{sec:learning_framework}

How did it learn anything at all?

Describe the learning strategy, the learning model, its parameters, any optimization over a given parameter set

Diagram with details of learning framework

CyclicLR has a paper describing it
